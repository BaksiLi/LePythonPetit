# LePythonPetit
This is a growing collection of small programs written in Python (mostly).

## Catalogue
### Small Scripts
- [Word Practice](./src/word_practice.py): A tiny typing practice script, inspired by a series of wrong typing when I type the password.   
- [ASCII Confess](./src/ascii_confess.py): An ASCII converting script, used to create a string of asciis, that contains information. I personally used this for love message encryption:- not too hard to decipher, and looks adequately neat.
- [Esperanto-English-Japanese-Etymology Dictionary](https://gist.github.com/BaksiLi/d4576e7bf3f40b2d98173bbd27dbc9a5): A combined dictionary.
- [Eastern-Western Typeset Formatter](./src/eastern-western_formatter.py): A auto-formatter for mixed typesetting of East-Asian (_Chinese Characters (Hanzi, Kanji, Hanja); Kana; Hangul) and Western (Greek; Latin; Cyrillic) elements.
<!-- This is a part of my future linter project. -->
