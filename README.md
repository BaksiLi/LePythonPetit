This is a growing collection of my small programmes.

## Catalogue
### Small Scripts
- word_practice: A tiny typing practice script, inspired by a series of wrong typing when I type the password.   
- ascii_confess: An ASCII converting script, used to create a string of asciis, that contains information. I personally used this for love message encryption:- not too hard to decipher, and looks adequately neat.

<sub>There are some scripts written for Alfred stored in [AlfredWorkflows](https://github.com/BaksiLi/AlfredWorkflows).</sub>

### Visualisation
- Timeline: Draw a timeline from a list of events.
